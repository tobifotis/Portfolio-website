##👨‍💻 Project Showcase: I recently completed this website to highlight my portfolio! 


###🛠️ Infrastructure Setup:
Set up a Linux 2 EC2 instance.
Connected it to an Application Load Balancer for scalability.

###🤖 Automation with Jenkins:
Installed Jenkins on the EC2 instance.
Used Jenkins to build the project from a custom Git repository.

###🌐 Web Development:
Modified a template from free-CSS to create a unique website.
Pushed code and dependencies to GitHub for version control.

###🔒 Securing the Site:
Mapped the Application Load Balancer URL to my site using Route 53.
Implemented TLS/SSL with ACM for secure communication.

###🔐 Enhancing Security:
Configured the load balancer to listen on port 443 for HTTPS.
Set up a redirect from port 80 to port 443 to ensure all traffic is secure.

#####This project was a fantastic learning experience, especially diving into HTML with no prior knowledge! It demonstrates a comprehensive CI/CD process, integrating Jenkins for automation and Git for version control.
